<p>Howdy Hey! My name is Jake Enger. I am a 23 year old man, with a very large interest in 
    gaming, computers, keyboards and music. I can build a computer fairly quickly if given all 
    the right parts, from actually assembling the tower itself to installing all the required software including
    drivers, operating system and whatever program is absolutely necassary for a computer to function, from game software
    to productivity things. I even have an active copy of Windows 10 on a flash drive that I keep on my keys at all times!

    My goal with my career is to not only do something that I enjoy, but also be able to live comfortably without worry
    of bankrupting myself if something goes wrong, or overworking myself and having my labor expoited. I am about a month and a half into
    a coding course, and while i absolutely hated it at first, I am quickly learning to enjoy it more and more.
</p>
